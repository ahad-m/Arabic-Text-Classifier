# Arabic-Text-Classifier
# Text Classification Models - Multi-Model Approach

## Overview
This repository implements a text classification system that uses three different models to predict the sentiment of input text. The following models are used for classification:

- **TF-IDF with ExtraTreesClassifier**
- **Word2Vec with LinearSVC**
- **FastText with SVC**

## Model Performance
Here are the accuracy results for each model:

- **TF-IDF with ExtraTreesClassifier**: Accuracy: **0.84**
- **Word2Vec with LinearSVC**: Accuracy: **0.81**
- **FastText with SVC**: Accuracy: **0.83**
